# Lab13.2

The goal of the task was to discover the effectiveness of the binary search tree for solving search tasks, using the methods of index for list and for tree: `add()` and `find()`. The functions that have to be done and their results is down:
- search in list
- search in alphabetically sorted binary tree
- search in non sorted binary tree
- search in rebalanced non sorted binary tree

Results:
```
Time needed for searching in list: 9.538525104522705 seconds

Time needed for searching in sorted-alphabetically tree: 16.516255140304565 seconds
The chosen number of elements is 25000 elements due to the restriction

Time needed for searching in not sorted tree: 0.04854774475097656 seconds

Time needed for searching in rebalanced tree: 0.03311276435852051 seconds
```

As we can see, the best result is when searching in the last case in rebalanced not sorted tree.
